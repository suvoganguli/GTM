Below are some interactive steps that show trimming, linearizing, and
plotting results with the sim.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run the {\tt setup} script from the top-level gtm\_design
  directory.  (Since paths are relative the sim should always be run
  from this directory.) Setup opens the simulation, sets paths, and
  trims to a nominal condition.
\item Select some output variables for the {\tt SelectOutputs} Bus Selector block located in
the top-level model block, including angle-of-attack ({\em Aux.alpha}).

\item \label{trim_step} Trim model to $3^\circ$ angle-of-attack, level
fight, and load variable-set (including trimmed inputs) into the
Simulink model workspace with the following two Matlab commands:
\begin{quote}
{\tt TrimPt=trimgtm(struct('alpha',3.0,  'gamma', 0.0));}\\
{\tt loadmws(TrimPt);}
\end{quote}
\item Start the simulation either with the menu {\em
Simulation$\rightarrow$Start} or with the command 
\begin{quote}{\tt sim('gtm\_design',[0 10]);}.\end{quote}
Plot resulting workspace outputs generated by block
NamedStore located in the top level Simulink model block, 
\begin{quote} {\tt plot(tout,sout.alpha);} \end{quote}
The results should be constant.

\item \label{angle_of_attack_step} Set angle-of-attack initial
condition to $1^\circ$, re-simulate and plot response:
\begin{quote}
{\tt MWSnew=seteomic(TrimPt,'alpha',1);}\\
{\tt loadmws(MWSnew);}\\
{\tt sim('gtm\_design',[0 3]);}\\
{\tt plot(tout,sout.alpha);}
\end{quote}
These results should show the vehicle dynamics for a small
perturbation off trim condition.


\item Linearize model about the nominal trim point computed in
step \ref{trim_step} and compare freq/damp of longitudinal dynamics to simulated response
of step \ref{angle_of_attack_step}.

\begin{quote}
{\tt [sys,lonsys,latsys]=linmodel(TrimPt);}\\
{\tt damp(lonsys)}
\end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

Most of the simulation functionality is illustrated in example scripts
({\tt example1,example2,\ldots}), these should run (after setup) and
produce results that compare to the plots in

./docs/plots/example\_plots.pdf
